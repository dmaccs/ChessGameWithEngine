# ChessGameWithEngine
To set the engines depth change the value of depth in Game. 
To play as black instead of white you need to change funcitonality in UI as I haven't made a system to detect which player is a engine so it is currently placing black as an engine by default.
Run game to play. I have found even depths to be stronger than odd depths as it ends on your opponents turns and I have yet to add value for having pieces attacked.
There is full functionallity for everything but once you are in checkmate or give checkmate the game just stops.
